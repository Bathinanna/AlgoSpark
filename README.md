# AlgoSpark

This Algospark project is an interactive frontend web application designed to visually demonstrate various sorting algorithms, making it easier to grasp algorithmic concepts through engaging visuals.other algorithms coming up in future.

## Project Features
- *Sorting Algorithms*: Visual demonstrations of popular sorting algorithms including:
  - *Bubble Sort*
  - *Selection Sort*
  - *Insertion Sort*
  - *Merge Sort*
  - *Quick Sort*
- *Dynamic Visuals*: Step-by-step animations that illustrate the sorting process in real-time.
- *Customization Options*: Users can adjust array size and algorithm speed for a personalized experience.

## Algorithms
Each algorithm is implemented with optimized and modular JavaScript code, enhancing both readability and efficiency.

### 1. Bubble Sort
A simple comparison-based algorithm that helps users understand the basics of sorting through clear visuals.

### 2. Selection Sort
An efficient algorithm suitable for sorting small lists, visually engaging to illustrate how it finds the minimum element repeatedly.

### 3. Insertion Sort
Quick to implement, this algorithm is efficient for small, nearly sorted data, showcasing how elements are built up in a sorted order.

### 4. Merge Sort
This divide-and-conquer algorithm demonstrates recursion in action, breaking down the sorting process into manageable parts.

### 5. Quick Sort
A classic sorting algorithm known for its good average-case performance, efficiently partitioning the array into subarrays.

## Code Structure
The project is organized with modular JavaScript files, promoting ease of understanding and customization. Each sorting function is well-documented, allowing for straightforward addition of more algorithms or adjustments to existing functionality.

## Practice Questions
To enhance your understanding of sorting algorithms, consider practicing with the following types of questions on coding platforms like *HackerRank* and *LeetCode*:
- *Implement Bubble Sort* from scratch.
- *Compare the performance* of different sorting algorithms on varying array sizes.
- *Analyze the time complexity* of each algorithm with real data.
- *Sort an array of objects* based on a specific property using one of the algorithms.
- *Implement and visualize* a new sorting algorithm (like Heap Sort or Radix Sort).

## Future Improvements
- Addition of more sorting algorithms, such as Heap Sort and Radix Sort.
- Enhanced user controls for custom array input, allowing users to input their own data.
- A toggle feature for dark/light mode to improve accessibility and user experience.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open index.html in a web browser to start using the visualizer.

## Built With
- *HTML*: Structure and layout of the application.
- *CSS*: Styling and responsive design.
- *JavaScript*: Logic and functionality for sorting algorithms.
- *Font Awesome*: For icons and enhanced UI elements.

## About
This project was developed by *Bathini Bathinanna* to demonstrate algorithmic concepts in a user-friendly and visually engaging way. The aim is to help users not only understand sorting algorithms but also appreciate their implementation and efficiency.
